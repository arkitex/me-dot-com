			<h3 class="projectName">PONTIFLEX APPLEADS</h3>
			<p class="projectCopy">Pontiflex Appleads is a pioneering mobile advertising solution available for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. I developed and maintained all the client side SDK code, working with Javascript, Objective-C, Java, and C#. I developed our Windows Phone and Windows 8 SDKs from the ground up, while working closely to add features to the Android and iOS side. I worked closely with the mobile business development team to support developers using our ad SDK, and ran the customer support site on my own.</p>

			<h3 class="projectName">ART INTERACTIVE</h3>
			<p class="projectCopy">The future of museum interaction. Art Interactive is a fast, fluid iOS app that allows museum exploration from the top down. Pull back to see all the museums in New York, and drill down to see each artwork in each museum. As the iOS development lead, I work closely with the founder and designer to make their ideas reality. Check out a sample <a href="projects/artinteractive.html">here</a>. </p>

			<h3 class="projectName">LAST RIDE IN</h3>
			<p class="projectCopy">Last Ride In is a transit framework that Matt Conlen and I built to easily view timetables on the desktop and mobile web. Built off of node-gtfs, it can pull gtfs files published by any transit authority and place them into a Mongo database. The data contained within is then served up using a server running on Node.js. The <a href="https://github.com/lab-curio/last-ride-in">source</a> is available on github. </p>

			<h3 class="projectName">MICROSOFT COUPON CLASSIFIER</h3>
			<p class="projectCopy">I spent a summer in Beijing, China, interning at the Microsoft Advanced Technology Center. While there, I built a naive bayesian classifier to classify over 10,000 coupons into distinct categories. I built it from the ground up in C# using SQL Server and ASP.Net. It used a combination of different machine learning algorithms to increase the accuracy of the classifier.</p>

			<h3 class="projectName">WINDOWS PHONE 7 JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE</h3>
			<p class="projectCopy">I found developing web apps for Windows Phone tremendously frustrating due to the lack of a browser console object. Referring to console crashes the entire app. So, I wrote a utility to pass console messages to the native layer. Get it <a href="https://github.com/arkitex/javascript-log-wp7">here</a>. </p>

			<p class="projectCopy">I barely use Pinterest, but when I do, I get annoyed at the subtle shades of pink that pervade every page. Annoyed enough to write a tiny chrome extension to unpink it! </p>
